# Console-Chess-Game

- MinMax algorithm is working at depth 2.</br>  					
If you change it to 3,4.. or deeper, bugs appear :D (I didn't have much time to look into it).</br>
</br>
-If anyone wants to look into the problem (and i welcome you to do so): </br>One would have to change the depth of MinMax manualy. To do so please follow these instructions: </br>
Simply go to class Game.cs navigate to line 238 and change the first argument of method call: "MiniMaxRootNode(2,true);" (change the "2") </br>

</br>
-So far, the game doesn't have logic to recognize "check-mate", this is in my TODO list.</br>
</br>
-The special move called "En passan" (Franch for: In moving) is not implemented.</br>
-Special moves "castling" and "promotion" are implemented and working. (not extensively tested)
